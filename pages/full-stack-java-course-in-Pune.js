                        <h3>Latest Technologies </h3>
                        <div>
                            <p> <TiArrowForward className='arrowFwd' /><b> 1. Spring Framework 6 ＆ Spring Boot 3 </b></p>
                            <p> Spring Framework 6: It is the latest major release of the Spring Framework aligned with modern Java paradigms. This way it is a full Jakarta EE 10 application server that conforms to the latest enterprise Java specs. Improvements for cloud-native support — with some emphasis on reactive programming and serverless architectures — in its flagship Spring 6 It also brings enhanced performance optimization and observability.</p>
                            <p> This release follows last month's Spring Framework 6 and is designed to improve the provisioning of microservices along with web applications that take out boilerplate code. Supports GraalVMNative to compile the applications into native images which reduces startup time and memory footprint very important in cloud environments.</p>

                            <p> <TiArrowForward className='arrowFwd' /><b> 2. Quarkus </b></p>
                            <p>  Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. This is expected to be in the game of optimizing Java for containers and hence will work quite well with microservices over a larger cloud native scale. Quarkus provides an excellent developer experience with features such as live coding and built-in integration for Kubernetes, helping to quickly develop a test or deployment application. Fast startup time and low memory footprint will make a big difference in the cloud-native world.</p>

                            <p> <TiArrowForward className='arrowFwd' /><b> 3. Jakarta EE 10 </b></p>
                            <p>Java EE 8 in a nutshell Jakarta EE 10 has evolved from Java EE under the stewardship of Eclipse Foundation. It is dedicated to reviving the enterprise Java ecosystem by driving modern standards for microservices, cloud-native application development, and reactive programming. Chances that your deployment environment will support all these options are slim, so you may have to stick with WeldRelease or just use the original J2EE version of CDIWelcome deeper emulation into other technologies such as RESTful web services and JSON processing which depending on wherever they land/status will make porting easier for those things. </p>

                            <p> <TiArrowForward className='arrowFwd' /><b> 4. Micronaut </b></p>
                            <p>Micronaut, JVM based framework for building microservices and serverless functions. Designed with cloud environments in mind, it is a very lightweight and modular solution that includes features like really fast startup times and minimal memory footprint. GraalVM provides seamless integration with Micronaut enabling developers to compile Java applications into native images. In addition, it natively supports reactive programming to fit a broad array of event-driven scalable applications as per demand. </p>

                            <p> <TiArrowForward className='arrowFwd' /><b> 5. GraalVM  </b></p>
                            <p>GraalVM is a powerful new high-performance runtime that extends JVM capabilities. Regarding this, a single runtime allows for the execution of applications written in different languages: Java, JavaScript (NodeJS), Python, Ruby, etc. One of the most remarkable features is that Quarkus can compile your Java applications into native images which can provide extremely fast startup time and low memory usage, qualities we all look for in cloud-native or serverless deployment formulations. </p>

                            <p> <TiArrowForward className='arrowFwd' /><b> 6. Reactive Programming(Project Reactor, RxJAVA)  </b></p>
                            <p>In the Java ecosystem, there are mainly two leading libraries for reactive programming Project Reactor and RxJava. Reactive programming is a style of writing code that focuses on building non-blocking, event-driven applications capable of serving many with few threads. Such libraries work great for the kind of modern cloud applications that need to service hundreds, or even thousands, of requests simultaneously. They play nice with frameworks such as Spring WebFlux and are capable of building fast-reaction microservices. </p>
